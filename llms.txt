# llms.txt for Vibe ADR
version: 1.0
last-updated: 2025-10-28

## OVERVIEW
- Purpose: help human and AI collaborators adopt the Vibe ADR workflow quickly and consistently.
- Tone: calm, intentional, and welcoming; mirror the vibe language captured in docs/decisions.
- Key decision: see docs/decisions/0002-define-llms-txt.md for the rationale anchoring this file.

## CONTEXT FILES
- README.md
- docs/decisions/0001-adopt-vibe-adr.md
- docs/decisions/0002-define-llms-txt.md
- templates/VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md

## NEW PROJECT SETUP
1. Create a `docs/decisions/` directory in the target project.
2. Copy `templates/VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md` (or the latest version in this repo) into the new project.
3. Draft `docs/decisions/0001-adopt-vibe-adr.md` in the new project to establish the workflow baseline.
4. Copy this `llms.txt`, adjust repository-specific details, and place it at the project root.
5. Reference `README.md` to mirror repository conventions and agent collaboration tips.
6. Commit the ADRs, template, and `llms.txt` together; include Conventional Commit prefixes (e.g., `docs:`).

## EXISTING PROJECT INTEGRATION
1. Audit current decision records and map them against the Vibe ADR structure.
2. Introduce `docs/decisions/` and migrate high-value decisions using the template.
3. Link back to historical decisions or external knowledge bases in the `More Information` section.
4. Add or update `llms.txt` at the repository root; ensure it references the local ADR inventory.
5. Update contributor docs to highlight ADR expectations and this `llms.txt` entry point.
6. Record confirmation evidence (tests, reviews) under each ADR’s `Confirmation` section.

## AI WORKFLOW GUIDANCE
- Load the context files above before proposing changes.
- Trim unused sections from the ADR template to keep documents concise.
- Update the `Feedback Log` with anything notable discovered during sessions.
- Use the `Next Steps` block in each ADR to outline follow-up actions for human reviewers.

## TRACEABILITY
- Quote ADR IDs (e.g., `0002-adr-description`) in commit messages that modify onboarding guidance.
- Keep `llms.txt` updates synchronized with the matching ADR confirmation notes.
