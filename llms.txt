# llms.txt for Vibe ADR
version: 1.0
last-updated: 2025-11-23

## OVERVIEW
- Purpose: help human and AI collaborators adopt the Vibe ADR workflow quickly and consistently.
- Tone: calm, intentional, and welcoming; mirror the vibe language captured in docs/decisions.
- Key decision: see docs/decisions/0002-define-llms-txt.md for the rationale anchoring this file.

## CONTEXT FILES
- README.md (the project's vibe and north star)
- docs/decisions/0001-adopt-vibe-adr.md
- docs/decisions/0002-define-llms-txt.md
- docs/decisions/VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md (copy this into your project's docs/decisions/ folder)

## BOOTSTRAP CHECKLIST
When setting up Vibe ADR in a new or existing project, create these files and directories:

1. **README.md** — Draft project purpose, philosophy, and guiding principles (not implementation details)
2. **docs/decisions/** — Create this directory to hold all ADRs
3. **docs/decisions/VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md** — Copy the template from this repo into your project
4. **docs/decisions/0001-adopt-vibe-adr.md** — Draft your first ADR using the template, and populate the **Anti-Goals & Guardrails** section beneath the Decision Outcome
5. **llms.txt** — Copy this file to your project root and update repository-specific details

**Important:** `llms.txt` is documentation *about* how to bootstrap Vibe ADR, not an artifact
added *during* the bootstrap. Agents read this file to understand what to create.

## WORKFLOW FOR NEW PROJECTS
1. Read this `llms.txt` to understand the Vibe ADR workflow
2. Review `README.md` in this repo for context and best practices
3. Create `README.md` in your project with your own vibe and north star
4. Create the `docs/decisions/` directory
5. Copy `VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md` into your `docs/decisions/` folder
6. Draft your first ADR (typically `0001-adopt-vibe-adr.md`) using the template
7. Trim unused template sections aggressively — the template is a guide, not law
8. Commit everything together with a Conventional Commit prefix (e.g., `docs: bootstrap vibe-adr`)

## WORKFLOW FOR EXISTING PROJECTS
1. Create `docs/decisions/` if it doesn't exist
2. Audit current architectural decisions and map them to the Vibe ADR structure
3. Copy `VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md` into your `docs/decisions/` folder
4. Migrate high-value decisions into ADRs, starting with an ADR that records the adoption decision
5. Add or update `llms.txt` at the project root with repository-specific guidance
6. Link historical decisions in the `More Information` section of ADRs
7. Update contributor docs to highlight ADR expectations

## AI COLLABORATION GUIDE
When working with AI agents on this project:

- **Load context first:** Always include README.md, relevant ADRs, and VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md
- **Trim the template:** Remove unused sections from each ADR aggressively; every project is different
- **Surface boundaries:** Populate Anti-Goals & Guardrails, then cite them when prompting agents or running Claude commands
- **Document learnings:** Update the `Feedback Log` section with insights discovered during implementation
- **Link commits:** Reference ADR IDs in commit messages (e.g., `docs: add ADR-0001 adoption guidance`)
- **Validate tests:** Record confirmation evidence in each ADR's `Confirmation` section
- **Plan next steps:** Use each ADR's `Next Steps` block to guide follow-up actions for humans

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST
Before committing ADRs and llms.txt:

- [ ] Run `npx markdownlint "**/*.md"` to catch formatting issues
- [ ] Run `npx markdown-link-check README.md docs/decisions/**/*.md` to validate links
- [ ] Confirm every ADR includes an **Anti-Goals & Guardrails** section with both lists filled
- [ ] Verify ADR numbering is sequential with zero-padding (0001, 0002, etc.)
- [ ] Confirm VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md lives in docs/decisions/ as the single source of truth
- [ ] Check that llms.txt references are accurate for your project

## TRACEABILITY
- Quote ADR IDs in commit messages that relate to onboarding or bootstrap changes
- Keep llms.txt synchronized with the matching ADR guidance (see 0002-define-llms-txt.md)
- Link confirming commits and PRs in each ADR's `Confirmation` section
