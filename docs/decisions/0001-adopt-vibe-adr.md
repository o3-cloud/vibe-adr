# Adopt Vibe ADR for Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a deliberate, repeatable way to capture architecture decisions while keeping the
repo lightweight. Previous work landed in ad-hoc notes, making it hard to track the
history, validation steps, and the emotional tone we want future collaborators to feel
when contributing.

## Vibe Context

Decision records should feel grounded, intentional, and calm. Contributors ought to
sense that the process welcomes thoughtful trade-offs without drowning in ceremony.
Each ADR should read like a conversation that guides both humans and AI partners.

## Decision Drivers

- Ensure every architectural change has a durable source of truth
- Keep ADR authoring fast enough for daily use by humans and AI agents
- Preserve the emotional through-line that the Vibe framework emphasizes

## Considered Options

- Maintain freeform Markdown notes per decision
- Adopt the Vibe ADR template and workflow within this repo
- Move decision tracking to an external tool (Notion, Confluence, etc.)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Adopt the Vibe ADR template and workflow"**, because it balances
structure, vibe alignment, and accessibility for both humans and AI agents while
keeping version control history close to the implementation changes.

### Consequences

- Good: Establishes a single, predictable location for every future ADR
- Good: Reinforces vibe-oriented language that keeps intent legible and empathetic
- Bad: Requires upfront discipline to keep numbering sequential and templates tidy

### Confirmation

- Add at least one follow-up ADR using this template
- Run `npx markdownlint "**/*.md"` before merging each ADR
- Periodically run `npx markdown-link-check README.md docs/decisions/**/*.md`

---

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Maintain Freeform Markdown Notes

- Good: Minimal overhead to start writing
- Bad: Inconsistent tone and metadata make automation brittle

### Adopt Vibe ADR Template (Chosen)

- Good: Encodes vibe guidance, metadata, and AI collaboration expectations
- Good: Works locally with Git history and Markdown linting
- Bad: Template trimming adds a small editing tax per ADR

### External Decision Tool

- Good: Built-in dashboards and notifications
- Bad: Splits context away from code, complicating AI agent prompts

---

## More Information

Revisit if ADR overhead blocks rapid iteration or if a richer automation suite emerges
that demands different metadata conventions.

# AI-Specific Sections

## AI Guidance Level

Chosen level: **flexible**

## AI Tool Preferences

- Primary tool: GPT-5 Codex CLI
- Model/version: GPT-5 (Codex CLI harness)
- Parameters: Default harness settings
- Context files: README.md, docs/decisions/\*.md, templates/VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md

## Test Expectations

- Test 1: Markdown lint passes with `npx markdownlint "**/*.md"`
- Test 2: Link validation passes with `npx markdown-link-check README.md docs/decisions/**/*.md`
- Acceptance criteria: Each ADR links to confirmation evidence once implementation lands

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

- Communicate ADR expectations in contributor onboarding
- Seed follow-up ADRs for near-term decisions

### Implementation Sequence

1. Reference `README.md` and this ADR in future agent prompts
2. Capture new decisions as `docs/decisions/NNNN-scope.md`
3. Link confirming commits in the `Confirmation` section

### Ownership

- Primary implementer: Owen Zanzal
- Supporting roles: GPT-5 Codex CLI
- Stakeholders to notify: Future repo collaborators

## Dependencies

- ADR-NNNN: None yet; this is the seed entry
- Component: Documentation workflow
- External dependency: Vibe ADR template assets

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- Template drift could erode consistency — mitigate with periodic lint checks

### Business Risks

- Additional authoring overhead might slow small decisions — mitigate by pruning
  unused template sections aggressively

---

## Human Review

- Review required: yes
- Reviewers: Owen Zanzal
- Review stage: before
- Review criteria: Style compliance, sequential numbering, confirmation clarity

---

## Feedback Log

### Implementation Notes

- 2025-10-28: Initial ADR drafted via GPT-5 Codex CLI session

### AI Agent Feedback

- GPT-5 Codex CLI (2025-10-28): Template adapts cleanly; recommend trimming unused
  sections each time

---

## Learning Reinforcement

- Preserving vibe-oriented language keeps decisions inviting
- Early metadata choices influence automation options later
- Pairing lint commands with ADR authorship prevents regressions
