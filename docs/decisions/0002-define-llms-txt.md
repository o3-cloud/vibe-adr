# Define llms.txt Bootstrap Instructions

## Context and Problem Statement

Future collaborators and AI agents need a single, machine-readable entry point that
explains how to implement Vibe ADR practices inside any project. Right now, agents rely
on README.md excerpts, which are verbose for automation and hard to keep aligned
across repositories. The llmstxt.org convention offers a standard file (`llms.txt`) for
agent onboarding, providing clear guidance on repo structure, required files, and setup
steps. We need a curated `llms.txt` that documents the Vibe ADR workflow itself — not
as part of the bootstrap, but as the _documentation that guides the bootstrap process_.

## Vibe Context

Bootstrapping should feel confident, welcoming, and low-friction. Agents and humans
should sense that the path to using Vibe ADR is paved, not improvised, and that the
instructions honor our calm, intentional tone.

## Decision Drivers

- Provide zero-guesswork guidance for AI agents entering the repo
- Keep onboarding instructions version-controlled alongside ADRs
- Reuse the emerging llms.txt ecosystem to stay interoperable

## Considered Options

- Publish a curated `llms.txt` at the repository root
- Depend solely on README.md and ADR references
- Host instructions in an external knowledge base or wiki

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"Publish a curated `llms.txt` at the repository root"**, because it
provides agents with a predictable, standards-aligned guide that explains the Vibe ADR
workflow and points them to the assets they need to understand how to implement it.
Importantly, `llms.txt` itself is _documentation about_ the bootstrap process — not an
artifact that gets added _during_ the bootstrap.

### Consequences

- Good: Standardizes AI onboarding with a discoverable, standards-based format
- Good: Keeps workflow guidance version-controlled and linked to ADR history
- Good: Agents can quickly understand what files to create and when
- Bad: Introduces another document that can drift without regular review
- Neutral: `llms.txt` lives in the reference repo; when bootstrapping a new project,
  agents read it to understand what to create (ADRs, template, directories, etc.)

### Confirmation

- Add `llms.txt` with clear instructions on bootstrapping Vibe ADR and commit alongside this ADR
- Validate formatting against the `llmstxt.org` guidance
- Verify that a new agent, reading only `llms.txt`, can successfully bootstrap Vibe ADR in a blank repo
- Reference this ADR in future updates to keep the file anchored to the decision

---

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Publish `llms.txt` (Chosen)

Following the llmstxt.org structure, define scope, required files, and setup steps in a
root-level artifact so any agent can understand the Vibe ADR workflow and bootstrap it
in a new repository.

- Good: Speaks the standard language emerging around agent onboarding
- Good: Lets other projects reuse the same workflow guidance with minimal edits
- Good: Makes it crystal clear what files to create (not what to add from this repo)
- Neutral: Requires new contributors to learn the llmstxt schema
- Bad: Adds upkeep each time onboarding guidance changes

### Depend on README.md and ADRs

Keep existing documentation only and expect agents to parse human-oriented sections.

- Good: No new files to maintain
- Bad: Agents must interpret narrative text and may miss critical steps

### External Knowledge Base

Document instructions in Confluence, Notion, or similar outside the repo.

- Good: Offers richer formatting and analytics
- Bad: Fragments context away from code and complicates offline use

## More Information

Revisit this decision if the llms.txt specification evolves significantly or if agents
report confusion despite the new file. Monitor llmstxt.org for version changes and
deprecation notices.

# AI-Specific Sections

## AI Guidance Level

Chosen level: **strict**

## AI Tool Preferences

- Primary tool: GPT-5 Codex CLI
- Model/version: GPT-5 (Codex CLI harness)
- Parameters: Default harness settings
- Context files: README.md, docs/decisions/\*.md, llms.txt once created

## Test Expectations

- Test 1: Run `npx markdownlint "**/*.md"` to guard ADR formatting each update
- Test 2: Manually verify `llms.txt` against llmstxt.org examples
- Acceptance criteria: Agents can locate Vibe ADR assets by following llms.txt links

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

- Draft `llms.txt` with sections for overview, required files, and setup checklist
- Link this ADR from the llms.txt footer for traceability

### Implementation Sequence

1. Create `llms.txt` at the repository root with clear sections for project overview,
   required files to create during bootstrap, setup checklist, and workflow expectations
2. Document that bootstrapping Vibe ADR in a new repo requires creating:
   - `README.md` (project vibe and north star)
   - `docs/decisions/` directory
   - `docs/decisions/VIBE_ADR_TEMPLATE.md` (copy of template into each project's decisions folder)
   - `docs/decisions/0001-adopt-vibe-adr.md` (first ADR decision)
3. Ensure `llms.txt` includes links to this reference repo's actual ADRs and template for examples
4. Keep README.md references aligned with `llms.txt` updates

- Component: Documentation workflow
- External dependency: llmstxt.org guidance

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- llms.txt schema may shift — mitigate by tracking spec updates quarterly
- Incomplete instructions could mislead agents — mitigate with real-world dry runs

### Business Risks

- Additional maintenance overhead — mitigate by pairing updates with ADR reviews

---

## Human Review

- Review required: yes
- Reviewers: Owen Zanzal
- Review stage: before
- Review criteria: llms.txt clarity, spec compliance, cross-links to ADRs

## Feedback Log

### Implementation Notes

- 2025-10-28: Decision recorded; llms.txt drafting pending execution

### AI Agent Feedback

- GPT-5 Codex CLI (2025-10-28): Recommend adding explicit links to README.md and
  ADR directory in the llms.txt body

---

## Learning Reinforcement

- Standards-aligned agent guidance scales better than bespoke prompts
- Tightly coupling ADRs with onboarding artifacts reduces drift
- Regular validation keeps automation-friendly docs trustworthy
